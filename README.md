## Reflection
This was a 2 day long project, given as internship trial for the company "Flexmoney".
The project goals is using technologies learned up until now and learning new things
to showcase your learning pace.

When I started this project, I only knew Mysql in theory, but after making this project
i can surely make new applications using SQL database easily.
